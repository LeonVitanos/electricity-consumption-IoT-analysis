# A predictive model for estimating the net electricity consumption of households equipped with solar panels

Experiment with
* exploring the data collected at a home and a weather station around the Eindhoven area,
* building a predictive model for estimating the amount of electricity produced by the solar panels at the home given a weather forecast.
    
Goal is to train a model on the time series data containing
* measurements of the amount of electricity produced by the solar panels on the roof of a home in the Eindhoven area
* weather measurements around the Eindhoven airport
in order to predict the hourly solar panel output given the weather forecast for a particular hour of a particular day.
