    "# Practical: Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will experiment with\n",
    "\n",
    "- exploring the data collected at a home and a weather station around the Eindhoven area,\n",
    "- building a predictive model for estimating the amount of electricity produced by the solar panels at the home given a weather forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the typical steps that such work would involve. It demonstrates how to explore and clean the data, and how to use it to train predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to train a model on the time series data containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- measurements of the amount of electricity produced by the solar panels on the roof of a home in the Eindhoven area\n",
    "- weather measurements around the Eindhoven airport\n",
    "\n",
    "in order to predict the hourly solar panel output given the weather forecast for a particular hour of a particular day.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who are new to jupyter notebooks, a typical notebook contains text cells (like this one) interleaved with code cells (the gray boxes). You can execute a cell by selecting it and pressing Shift+Enter. The expression in the last line in a cell is the output of that cell. Try executing the following cell."

    "Throughout this notebook you will find cells starting with `#TODO` and `#BEGIN_TODO`. Fill in all these TODO cells. The `#TODO` cells are meant to guide you, while the `#BEGIN_TODO` _answer cells_ will be graded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer cells start and end with tags, `# // BEGIN_TODO [Q0]` and `# // END_TODO [Q0]`, for example. Do not edit these tags in any way, else your answers may not be parsed by our grading system. \n",
    "- Your answers should be provided in Python code format between the tag lines, for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# // BEGIN_TODO [Q0]\n",
    "q0 = 1\n",
    "# // END_TODO [Q0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Do not place any other code between the tags, unless explicitly requested.\n",
    "- Do not reuse the variable names from the answer cells that you are supposed to use to fill in answers, so in case of the example above, do not reuse `q0` later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to play with the data and extend this notebook in order to obtain your answers. You may insert cells at any point in the notebook, as long as the question cells remain unaltered. At the end, deliver the filled in `.ipynb` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **IMPORTANT:** Before delivering your notebook, make sure that the cells in your notebook can be executed in sequence without errors, by executing \"Restart & Run All\" from the \"Kernel\" menu. This is also how your notebook will be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started by filling in your details in the following answer cell. Assign your names and student ids to variables `name_student1`, `id_student1`, `name_student2`, `id_student2`, e.g.:\n",

These lines correspond to 0 values and are likely to be measurement errors (e.g. the solar panel meter has crashed). Such outliers will often negatively impact the accuracy of the predictive model. However, care must be taken to properly define what constitutes an outlier and what constitutes a valid measurement. Some odd looking measurements may actually contain important evidence for proving or disproving a hypothesis. In this case the 0 values can be considered measurement errors and should be removed.\n",
